## 📖 Overview
The **Smart Sanitation Monitoring System** is an **IoT-powered solution** that enhances hygiene management in public and private restrooms.  
By combining real-time sensors with smart automation, the system continuously tracks usage, detects hygiene issues, and triggers alerts for maintenance.  

This helps maintain clean and safe environments while minimizing manual supervision and ensuring timely response to sanitation needs.

## 🚩 Problem Statement
Public sanitation facilities are often unhygienic due to:
- 🚫 Rigid cleaning schedules that ignore real-time usage  
- 🗑️ Overflowing bins and unpleasant odors  
- 💧 Slippery floors due to unattended wet areas  
- ⚠️ Lack of accountability in maintenance  

These lead to **health risks** and **poor user experiences**.  
The **Smart Sanitation Monitoring System** offers a **data-driven, automated** solution to these issues.

## ⚙️ System Description
The project integrates an **ESP32 microcontroller** with multiple sensors and output modules to automate washroom monitoring and maintenance.

### 🧩 Components Used
| Component | Function |
|------------|-----------|
| **ESP32** | Core processing and connectivity unit (Wi-Fi + Bluetooth) |
| **IR Sensor** | Detects motion and occupancy |
| **Humidity & Odor Sensors** | Identify wet floors and foul smells |
| **Relay Module** | Controls external devices (e.g., fans, cleaning systems) |
| **OLED / LCD Display** | Displays system information like “Last Cleaned” or “Wet Floor Detected” |
| **Buzzer** | Audio alerts for maintenance needs |
| **Keypad** | For user input and system control |

---

## 🧠 Working Principle
1. The **IR sensor** detects usage and motion inside the washroom.  
2. **Humidity and odor sensors** measure environmental conditions.  
3. The **ESP32** processes input data and displays live updates.  
4. If thresholds (odor, humidity) are exceeded, **alerts are triggered** via buzzer or connected dashboard.  
5. Maintenance staff receive **real-time notifications** for cleaning actions.  

This creates a **smart, self-monitoring environment** with minimal human supervision.
